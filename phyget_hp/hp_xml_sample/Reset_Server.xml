<!-- Description:  This is a sample XML script to power cycle (off   -->
<!--               and then back on) the host server in which the    -->
<!--               Integrated Lights-Out(iLO) is operating.          -->

<!-- NOTE:  You will need to replace the USER_LOGIN and PASSWORD     -->
<!--        values with values that are appropriate for your         -->
<!--        environment.                                             -->

<!--        This script will NOT attempt to gracefully shutdown the  -->
<!--        host operating system before it powers off the server.   -->

<!--        If graceful shutdown is needed (if your OS supports it), -->
<!--        use the Set_Host_Power.xml script (with                  -->
<!--        SET_HOST_POWER HOST_POWER="No") to attempt a graceful    -->
<!--        shutdown of the OS before powering off the server and    -->
<!--        then use the Set_Host_Power.xml script (with             -->
<!--        SET_HOST_POWER HOST_POWER="Yes") to turn the server back -->
<!--        on.                                                      -->

<!--        Use HPQLOCFG.EXE v1.00 or greater with this script.      -->
